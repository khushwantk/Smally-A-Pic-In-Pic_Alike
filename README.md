# Smally-A-Pic-In-Pic


This is an app that will allow you to open any screen, application, or tab in a movable, resizable, window that will stay on top of anything you do. So you can have a small video in the corner of your screen while you are working on something in the background.

## Instructions

When you load the page, you will see a button showing "LET'S PLAY". Simply Click it.

You can select whatever screen, application, or browser tab you want to share.

When you make your selection, click "View" to begin the picture in picture.

Either click "Stop" or simply the 'X' to close picture in picture.
